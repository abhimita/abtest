# A/B Testing

This project is part of Udacity's data analyst course. A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. Data wrangling is the focus of the project. 

The project deals with A/B test run by a hypothetical e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The goal is to work through this notebook to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.
